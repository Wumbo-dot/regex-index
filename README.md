# regex-index

This challenge allowed for the deeper dive into regex, or regular expressions in JavaScript.

The user story is as follows:
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines.

Not only does this have a definition for common regex terms, but also contains a piece about the author.
