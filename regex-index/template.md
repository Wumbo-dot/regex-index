## Regex Components

Regex components allow us to search a string or line or lines of code for specific characters, or grouping of characters.
They help us form rules for the searches to follow and match with.
### Anchors

Anchors are vital to regex, as they allow for the use of characters and symbols that help determine rules.  
They help determine if the rules are before or after certain characters.
### Quantifiers

Quantifiers indicate the number or quantity of the search rules.
These can be either for preceding or concluding items in the regex.
### OR Operator

Or operators are utilized to show either a rule before and item, or after the regex item in question.
It is best exemplified by the pipe character "|".

### Character Classes

Character classes are used to specify or distingush characters, for example digits and individual letters or groups or letters.
### Flags

Flags affect the search in the regex rules.
There are 6 flags we can use: i, g, m, s, u, and y.

### Grouping and Capturing

Grouping allows for us to match text and extract information set out in the regex rules.
Capturing allows for the use of multiple characters in a single unit as a single unit.
### Bracket Expressions

Brackets are used to indicate which character to match with in the regex rules.
You can have individual characters in the brackets or have them seperated by hypens.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy matches are those matches that match with as many characters as possible.
A lazy match allows for the minimum matches to be displayed first.
### Boundaries

Boundaries let the user know of the rules can be used to the right or left of the current position.
Some common boundaries are \b, \B, [[:<:]], and [[:>:]].
### Back-references

Back-refrences match the same characters or text as was previously matched.
This helps with making sure that parts of a string match as well as parts of the pattern match.
### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead matches with what comes after a certain position in the string or line.
Look-behind matches with what comes before a certain position in the string or line.
Both of these search terms can have positive or negative aspects.
